At the beginning of the last year (2019), I promised myself that would contribute more to the Free and Open source software and community (or become frequent blogger??). In order to do that, (and of course, I needed it) I started working on a small project called [drone-cache](https://github.com/meltwater/drone-cache). While I was working on that project I also wanted to give a try to my long awaiting passion-to-be blogging. And I managed to write [my first ever blog post](https://kakkoyun.github.io/2019/04/10/making-drone-builds-10-times-faster/), where I actually told the story of how I built the drone-cache.

Of course, I couldn't make it happen. You know why? Because life happened! (or as I always do I over-promised :D) I decided to change jobs and find one that would challenge me more! (as the elder always say, be careful what you wish for) Long story short, after searching for a job for a couple of months, the dream job found me!. But even searching part had taken a considerable amount of time and energy from me. ...

T-shape career growth, finding true passion. Already have been on it: distributed computing.

Observability. Performance optimizing. Simple, correct, fast. 

Last July I started my journey at Red Hat, Openshift Observability Platform team. Since then I learned a ton! Still learning, and challenging myself in every possible way. But it hurts1 I guess this is a good thing, you know what they say (no pain, no gain! | if it hurts it works) :(trollface:!) \[Arnold\]

In this constant masochistic self pushing journey, I also decided to overcome one of my biggest fear: stage fear? Public speaking!!! For that, with amazing Bartek Plotka, @bwplotka!

We gave our talk on building "[Are you testing your Observability?](https://github.com/kakkoyun/are-you-testing-your-observability)" observable services/applications with Golang at [GoDays 2020](https://youtu.be/LU6D5cNeHks) [Berlin and FOSDEM 2020](https://video.fosdem.org/2020/UD2.120/testing_observability.mp4)!

### What's next?

Exactly at this point in my life, in the known universe, this year I would like to challenge myself more and this time keep my promise to be a more active blogger, I will start a blog series where I will dig in more on concepts of building observable distributed systems (which is an area that I myself still learning). While I'm learning about this I'd like to share my experience as well. So in the first part of this series, I will start elaborating the concepts that we have talked about. Give examples, challenge the ideas more and try to come up some with some good practices and share my learnings!
